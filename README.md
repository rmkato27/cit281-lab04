This lab involves setting up a Fastify Node.js web server, initializing it with npm, adding Fastify, managing the project with git including handling node_modules, fixing MIME issues, and adding a second route with query parameters for testing and committing changes.

this lab really showed the back end coding part of a webpage, i really learned alot during this lab and subsequent project, because I was able to see how the server code and html code and module codes interacted with each other in this lab and project. Usingg Fastify to create a url and actual webpage was cool.
